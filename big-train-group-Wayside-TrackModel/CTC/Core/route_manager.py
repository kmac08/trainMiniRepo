Route Manager Module
==================
Manages route generation, validation, and scheduling according to UML specifications.
Separate from the routing engine to handle higher-level route management.

This module handles:
- Route generation and optimization
- Route validation and scheduling
- Block reservation management
- Alternative route finding
- Route conflict resolution
