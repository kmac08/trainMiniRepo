class FailureManager:
    """
    ✅ REFACTORED: Focused failure detection and emergency response system.
    
    This class implements failure detection algorithms and emergency response procedures.
    After refactoring, it focuses solely on actual failures and emergencies, delegating
    maintenance scheduling to CTC System and block operations to Block classes.
    
    REFACTORING CHANGES:
        ✅ Removed scheduled closure/opening management (moved to CTC System)
        ✅ Delegates block operations to Block class methods
        ✅ Focuses purely on failure detection and emergency response
        ✅ Maintains only maintenance closure tracking for coordination
    
    Core Failure Management:
        failedBlocks (List[Block]): Currently failed track blocks
        failedTrains (List[Train]): Currently failed trains
        failure_history (List[dict]): Historical failure records
        active_emergencies (Dict[str, dict]): Active emergency situations by ID
        
    Emergency Response:
        recovery_actions (Dict[str, dict]): Recovery status tracking by failure ID
        stopped_trains (Set[str]): Train IDs stopped due to failures
        
    Maintenance Coordination (Tracking Only):
        maintenanceClosures (Dict[str, List[int]]): Active closures by line (for tracking)
        NOTE: Scheduling moved to CTC System - FailureManager only tracks active closures
        
    System Integration:
        ctc_system: Reference to main CTC system
        communication_handler: Reference to communication system
        display_manager: Reference to display system
        
    Methods Overview:
        Failure Detection & Management:
            - find_affected_trains(): Identify trains impacted by failures
            - check_for_failures(): Scan system for new failures
            - add_failed_block(block): Register block failure (delegates to Block.set_block_failed)
            - add_failed_train(train): Register train failure with emergency response
            - remove_failed_block(block): Remove from failed list (delegates to Block.set_block_failed)
            - clear_failure(failure_id): Mark failure as resolved and clean up
            
        Emergency Response:
            - reroute_trains(): Attempt automatic rerouting around failures
            - stop_trains(): Emergency stop all affected trains
            - generate_emergency_routes(trains): Create alternative routes for affected trains
            - get_failure_impact(failure_id): Analyze impact of specific failure
            
        Train Emergency Detection:
            - detect_train_emergencies(threshold): Advanced stationary train detection
            - Uses individual train movement history for accurate detection
            - Threshold-based detection (default: 3 consecutive stationary updates)
            - Only monitors trains with active routes and suggested speed > 0
            - Prevents duplicate emergency creation for same train
            
        REMOVED METHODS (moved to CTC System):
            ❌ get_scheduled_closures() → Use CTC System
            ❌ cancel_scheduled_closure() → Use CTC System
            ❌ process_scheduled_closures() → Use CTC System
            ❌ process_scheduled_openings() → Use CTC System
            
        Safety & Recovery:
            - Automatic train stopping when failures detected
            - Emergency route generation avoiding failed infrastructure
            - Recovery action tracking and coordination
            - Impact analysis for operational planning
            
    Failure Types Handled:
        Block Failures:
            - Infrastructure failures (track, signals, switches)
            - Track circuit failures
            - Power system failures
            - Communication failures
            
        Train Failures:
            - Mechanical failures
            - Communication failures
            - Emergency brake activation
            - Stationary train detection (trains stopped unexpectedly)
            
        System Failures:
            - Communication system failures
            - Control system failures
            - General system malfunctions
            
    Emergency Detection Algorithm:
        - Monitors trains with active routes and speed commands > 0
        - Uses train's individual movement_history for accurate tracking
        - Detects trains stationary for configurable threshold (default: 3 updates)
        - Creates emergency records with detailed information
        - Prevents duplicate emergencies for same train
        - Integrates with display manager for immediate notification
        
    Integration Features:
        - Real-time communication with wayside controllers
        - Display manager integration for UI updates
        - CTC system state synchronization
        - Automatic emergency response coordination
        - Recovery action tracking and reporting
        
    Safety Features:
        - Immediate train stopping upon failure detection
        - Alternative route generation for continued operations
        - Comprehensive impact analysis for decision support
        - Historical tracking for trend analysis
        
    Performance Features:
        - Efficient failure detection algorithms
        - Minimal overhead for normal operations
        - Fast emergency response times
        - Optimized data structures for quick lookups
        - Thread-safe operations for real-time updates
        
    ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
        ✅ Single Responsibility Principle: Only handles failures, not maintenance
        ✅ Delegation Pattern: Uses Block methods instead of duplicating functionality
        ✅ Clear Separation: Maintenance scheduling is now in CTC System
        ✅ Reduced Complexity: ~300 lines removed, focused on core failure handling
